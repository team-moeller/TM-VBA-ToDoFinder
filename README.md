# The idea
When working in the VBA editor, it often happens that you have an idea that you cannot implement immediately. There may also be some tasks left open shortly before the end of the day.
You might jot down such tasks and ideas on a scrap of paper or a post-it. You may also store your notes in an electronic medium. Why not add relevant notes as a comment in your VBA code?
