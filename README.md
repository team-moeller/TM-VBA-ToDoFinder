# TM-VBA-ToDoFinder
Find ToDos in your VBA code
# The idea
When working in the VBA editor, it often happens that you have an idea that you cannot implement immediately. There may also be some tasks left open shortly before the end of the day.<br>
You might jot down such tasks and ideas on a scrap of paper or a post-it. You may also store your notes in an electronic medium. Why not add relevant notes as a comment in your VBA code?<br>
In the Visual Studio and other editors, you can insert open tasks as comments in your source code. All open tasks are then clearly listed in an additional window. There is no such function in the VBA editor. This add-in now closes this gap.<br>
#Funtionality
The TM VBA-ToDoFinder offers you the following options:

* Open tasks can be inserted into the VBA code as a comment.
* The TM VBA-ToDoFinder clearly lists all tasks inserted in this way.
* Double-clicking a task jumps to the corresponding line in the VBA code.
* The label for open tasks can be adjusted via the options dialog.
